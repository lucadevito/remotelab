# Remote laboratory

This project aims to develop a laboratory server for providing remote experiments using actual instrumentation.
Three options of interface are planned:

- VNC or RDP (useful for workstations and Windows-based instrumentation);
- web (many recent instruments provide a remote panel accessible through web, e.g. Tektronix eScope)
- VXI-11 (to be included)
